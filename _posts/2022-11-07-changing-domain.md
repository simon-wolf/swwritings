When I created a hosted instance of Mastodon for myself I registered a new domain name, sgawolf.com. I've decided to move this blog to that domain name and you can now find it at [https://blog.sgawolf.com/](https://blog.sgawolf.com).

The site itself should redirect but hopefully this will show up for anyone who follows but blog via the RSS feed. Could you please change the URL for the feed to [https://blog.sgawolf.com/feed.xml](https://blog.sgawolf.com/feed.xml).
